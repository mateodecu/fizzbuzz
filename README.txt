| README for the Fizzbuzz Application |
=======================================

Fizzbuzz is a RESTful webservice application designed to fulfill the necessity of
generating new Fizzbuzz series in any given situation

What are Fizzbuzz series?

When counting forward from any given number, the series must be constructed by replacing
every number divisible by three, with the word “Fizz”; any number divisible by five,
with the word “Buzz”; and any number divisible by both, with the word “Fizzbuzz”

The Fizzbuzz application allows the user to set a starting number for the series and
its length, and by submitting the form, the application will return a Json array with
the proper Fizzbuzz series. Moreover, the application will also take record of every
Fizzbuzz series generated by different users simultaneously with a datetime signature
in a text log file.

The application has been developed with use of Java Spring Framework, Maven build
automation tool for dependencies managment, GitHub version control hosting service
and design patterns such us Singleton pattern for the register writer class.
